Everytime a players dies they'll respawn as an spirit who'll need to find a Spirit Healer to revive.

## Configuration

You can choose to block the spirits from opening doors by setting to false the `ghostOpenDoors` option, just be mindful that this could prevent players from getting outside their houses.

```toml
#Not Quite Death
[general]
	#If players can open and close doors on Ghost mode
	ghostOpenDoors = false
```
